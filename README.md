A few additional unique code samples:

*PS5: ps5-zachcerickson/src/minPQ.java and linkedminPQ.java*

Just some simple priority queue code from a Computer Science II java course.

*PS6: ps6-zachcerickson/src/bin/typechecker.ml*

Part of a principles of programming languages course. We would create a language throughout the semester.
This is a type-checker for a mini programming language that handles elementary functions of products, sums, evaluation, and recursion.

*bike_rental copy*

This was part of a SQL-oriented course. This was the schema for our final project of sorts.
